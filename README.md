While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

Furthermore, our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
